# Housing-for-every-family-in-any-country
Could we ensure the housing-a basic need for every family in any country?  A Long Term Goal – Through Countrywide Greater Co-operative Measures with the help of Government:

This is an idea, I have derived long ago to reach the goal “Housing for every family, everybody”, in any country. We know that any State is actually a great communion of all the citizens of that country.

This idea is based on that great co-operation of every citizen to have their own house through their day to day gradual contribution to a special “Citizen’s Housing Account” (CiHAc) lead by the Govt.

This gradual contribution is a very negligible amount per every citizen or every family that would be contributed automatically to that "CiHAc" from their any type of financial account daily, even it could be from their mobile recharging amount or mobile accounts!

This contribution or daily savings amount might be 1 country currency (like 1 BDT or 1 dollar) to preferred custom amount say 25 to 100 country currency or more set by any citizen by him or herself regarding their own ability and might vary on time. The collection process and to manage the very big workflow, we need to invent secured apps and IoT and digital machines.

Here every citizen means the all income-generating people or family heads those are earning as well might be all young adults (Hopefully, for Bangladesh it might be 12 crores or 120 millions). Family heads could set up if the savings could be in name for each member or not. Even contribution for a toddler will be worth someday!

Thus every member of a family is contributing to making great national savings for their own housing in time regarding their ability of contribution which means, those who contribute more in time, will get their house in a shorter period.

On this way every day a very big amount will be accumulated in that great “CiHAc” Account which again will incur savings interest and within a couple of months, any Government could start to make housing for its citizens.

Here I also like to provoke for Government Association to help this great economic communion by giving subsidized Government lands for development and this subsidy could be returned through tolls or not as planned. 
Another approach could be that houses could be made on every family's existing land. Even the government could negotiate to build highrise apartments on their existing land while giving them the proper benefits. 
Thus any state could house their citizens or all families in time through a greater co-operative economy. This idea also could be adopted in health, education, etc., sector s.
Here are the other examples in which this idea could be extended.
1. To help every family head with a one-time noteworthy amount.
When the collection of money reach a very big amount, the government can donate a noteworthy amount at one time ( like .5 million) to the family heads. Priority should be given on the basis of poorness. Also, the government could fund some commercial projects that might be run by those family heads or in public-private partnership projects or will assist in buying shares of noteworthy private businesses to ensure a monthly income of those families. 

2. Donation- Sometimes we see that some very sick individuals or injured individuals by accidents instantly need a great amount of money to survive. Through this big co-operative account, we could help them instantly. Again some community or groups could use this idea and the necessary apps to build up some savings to donate or use it in other ways.

3. Sometimes it is seen that, country faces food crisis or some regions of it. This system might have a branch to cater such issue.

 

Actually, by this idea, we are helping each other with our own contribution by a very small amount of money accumulated or collected on a daily basis and almost silently to a government-led social beneficiary account. This system could be extended further by insisting the capable rich people to donate so that the progress will be more faster.

But to manage the entire process i.e., from savings to making I devised some other ideas to prevent any kind of corruption or anomalies, should share in the future.
Thus we could ensure housing- a basic need for every family in any country.

Note: The above idea could have difficulties in detail but we need to work out on them. One major problem will be a big amount of time will be needed to housing every family. In this case, at first, the poor section of the society should be housed with the help of all citizen. Then the rest gradually.

Workflow:
To make this vision real, we need to develop an automated system of money collection from mobile or bank accounts subjected to the permissions of account holders as well as to save it in a State led account. This savings for will be then gradually used to make housing for every family, specially for the needy first.
Though for the later phase, i.e., using the savings for construction of housing, I like to propose another idea for automated distribution of payment to vendors or suppliers and to construction related all people, on the basis of the approval of AI led automated checking systems of material quality, workmanship, delivery date as well major issues of any construction etc., to minimize corruptions specially in corruption prone countries.

Contribution: 
Money collection:
Actually, money collection system through devices and accounts already exists in financial institutions. We need to create or import such system with extra care for security and I like to suggest for blockchain incorporation with/without crypto. When with crypto, we need to make it suitable for normal currencies like dollars etc.

Deployment of money collection system:
Then we need any Country's Government approval to build a State owned CIHAC, which will take care to collection of build fund for Housing. We also could build and deploy the money collection system in smaller scale like for a co-operative society of 50,000 people who willing to save money through this automated money collection system to their central account.

Automated money distribution system:
We need to build up AI led checking system for whole construction and these data will be used to trigger the automated payment of vendors, suppliers, contractors etc.

Deployment:
Existing construction machineries could be transformed into AI based systems.
